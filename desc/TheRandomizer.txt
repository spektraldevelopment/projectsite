I will attempt to port a Flash application I made a few years back into JS. The randomizer utilized the YouTube API. It basically takes any YouTube video and allows the user to loop and randomize the video resulting in some unintentional hilarious, albeit bizarre results. Hopefully the JS version of the YouTube API will be up to task performance wise. More to come...
