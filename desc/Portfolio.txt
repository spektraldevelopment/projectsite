My first attempt at a portfolio site built using HTML5 ( aka HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ). Coming from three and half years of working solely in ActionScript 3, it had been awhile since I worked outside of the Flash environment . Working with AS3, I became very well acquainted with Object Oriented Programming, and wished to carry over that knowledge to JS. For my first foray using OOP in JS, it turned out alright, however I think I used "this", one too many times. Green Sock had just released their Animation Platform in JS, I was already familiar with TweenLite/TweenMax, so it was a perfect choice for all the animations.
