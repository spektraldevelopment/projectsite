Soon into my working with JS, I realized that I was amassing a collection of reusable code that I needed on a regular basis. At first I put them in their own separate JS file, but soon I wrapped an anonymous function around them and set out to create a library of my own. Now you might say "Why would you do that when you can just use jQuery, Dojo, Moo Tools etc. ?" I do use those libraries, and they're great, but I like to know my code inside and out.  Plus building a library is a great way to learn the ins and outs of JavaScript. Currently the project is in it's infancy, theirs no documentation yet and no minified version ( something I hope to address in the near future).
