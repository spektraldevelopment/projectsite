I wanted to get a feel for a handful of the most popular masonry plugins, to determine there ease of use. I found that Masonry and Isotope were the most established and easy to use, the options and documentation were helpful. I did find however that all plugins work better in a container with a fixed width, when it came to producing a precise look.That being said, they are able to be adapted to a responsive layout.
