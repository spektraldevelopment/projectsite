Welcome! I built this site with nothing but my bare hands ( and by bare hands I mean a computer, a stack of reference books, and the internet ). These are personal projects I'm currently working on, they range from "complete" to "still in the works". Hopefully, within these pages you may learn something you didn't know, or find something that will save you precious time when you're approaching that dreaded deadline. Enjoy!
